<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Homonyms are words that have the same pronounciation and spelling, but different meanings. For example, the words “<strong>free</strong>” and “<strong>free</strong>“.<br>
Free and free are both spelled <strong>F</strong>–<strong>R</strong>–<strong>E</strong>–<strong>E</strong>, and are both pronounced the same, but have completely different meanings, making them <strong>homonyms</strong>. In this article, we will be focusing on <strong>free [of]</strong>, meaning without, and <strong>free</strong>, meaning not costing anything.</p>
<h3>Free socks are not free</h3> <p><em>[body]</em><br><br>
This is because the first free in free free socks <strong>refers to the free meaning</strong> “<strong>without</strong>“<strong>,</strong> as in “<strong>is free of</strong>“<strong>.</strong> The second free then refers to the meaning of free as in “<strong>without cost</strong>“. The phrase “free free socks” then roughly translates to “<strong>without without cost socks</strong>“. Just like saying something is “<strong>not not blue</strong>“, the two “without”s cancel each other out, leaving you with the simple “<strong>[is] blue</strong>“, and, in our case, “<strong>[is cost] socks</strong>“.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We’ve now just proved that saying socks are “free free” is a <strong>void statement.</strong> The two “free”s cancel each other out, making the socks just that; <strong>socks</strong>. And just like any socks, <strong>free free socks aren’t free</strong>.</p><br><br><br>
